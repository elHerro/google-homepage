The Odin Project - Web Basics 101

With this project I hope to put in practice all that I've learned about CSS and HTML.

The goal of this project is to make a clone of the Google homepage.

The Odin Project also asks you to make the results webpage as an (optional) difficult task. 
We will try to do it once we finish the first part of this challenge.
